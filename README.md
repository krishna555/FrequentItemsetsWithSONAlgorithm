# FrequentItemsetsWithSONAlgorithm
Finding Frequent Itemsets using SON with the Apriori Algorithm in Python and Scala.

1. Implemented SON Algorithm with Apriori Algorithm to identify all possible combinations of frequent itemsets. Two tasks were implemented:

   1. Calculate the combinations of frequent businesses (as singletons, pairs, triples, etc.) that are qualified as “frequent” given a support threshold.
   
   2. Calculate the combinations of frequent users (as singletons, pairs, triples, etc.) that are qualified as “frequent” given a support threshold.
